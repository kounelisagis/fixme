      '- `h1` needs to be visually centered in the space between the image and the social icons.\n- Remove `\u003cb\u003e` tag from `Help us`\n- `class="share-button"` appears to be sitting low within the pill background. When experimenting I increased bottom padding to 22px and this appeared to visually center.\n\n\u003cimg width="1054" alt="social-overlay" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18686986/41928898-855e34a4-792b-11e8-9c1a-c86a77baa762.png"\u003e',

      description:
        "The Common Voice project is Mozilla’s initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.\nVoice is natural, voice is human. That’s why we’re fascinated with creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create voice systems, an extremely large amount of voice data is required.\n\nMost of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we’ve launched Project Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open to everyone.",
