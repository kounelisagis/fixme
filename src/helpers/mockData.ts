CSP errors because http://s3proxy/... wasn\'t mentioned in `media-src`\n2. s3proxy not found\n\nI\'ve worked around the issue locally by:\n\n* In docker-compose.yml: exposing port 80 of the s3proxy machine as 9090 on localhost\n* Adding `.replace("s3proxy:80", "localhost:9090");` to [`getPublicUrl`](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/1c143e40f914460425b682345d53875358d1806d/server/src/lib/bucket.ts#L23-L29)\n* Adding `http://localhost:9090/` to the whitelisted items in the CSP\n\nIt would be cool if all of this got set up per default, e.g. by setting values in local-docker-config and then reading them in the appropriate places. This would make it much easier for users to start contributing and to try out changes locally!',

      "We considered adding a component styling library, like styled-components, but with those we have to pay the extra size-price (between 8kb-14kb, depending on the lib). So, a better approach might be to take what we already have to a better place. Even if we make the decision to switch to one of those libs after, the effort wouldn't be in vain, since cleaner DRYer styles are easier to port.\n\nSo this is a meta-issue for tracking everything that we can do to make our styling saner. Discussion, other ideas and PRs very much wanted \u0026 appreciated!\n\n- [ ] Standardise\n  - [ ] Margins/Padding (atm we probably have \u003e~ 10 different values) \n  - [ ] Font Sizes (atm \u003e~ 8 differnet values)\n  - [x] Colors\n  - [x] Transitions\n- [ ] Prefer nesting over selector repetition ([example](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/commit/411bd75a57ac368bcf44a0f697f5137fca3ba0c0))\n  - While deep nesting is hard to read, I prefer it over the more error-prone selector repetition (also deep nesting being difficult to read, might incentivize componentizaation)\n- [ ] Bootstrap-like mobile-first breakpoints ([example](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/commit/6415f246b6a42c59a610fcf27fff38e7bbf73d05))\n  - When we're done, we can delete the [old breakpoints](https://github.com/mozilla/voice-web/blob/6415f246b6a42c59a610fcf27fff38e7bbf73d05/web/src/components/vars.css#L63-L67)\n- [ ] Require CSS files in their respective component js files\n- [ ] Styleint\n  - [ ] order of attributes (imo it should be \"position \u003e display \u003e margin \u003e padding \u003e size \u003e color/opacity/etc. \u003e transition \u003e sub-selectors\")\n  - [ ] forbid new values for colors etc (to enforce standardisation)\n  - [ ] run sth like `stylelint --fix` with our `prettier` task\n- [ ] stop depending on route name for css classes\n  - in `layout.tsx` we set the content's classname to the route and depend on those names all over the place\n- [ ] don't select for tags or specific components. give context specific classNames",
